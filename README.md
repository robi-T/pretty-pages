# Pretty Pages
## Your story in the digital world on your own terms

With this project my itention is to prototype a digital hoby-press system using available open source technologies. 
End product should be easy to set up and easy to use for non-techie people, writers that should be able to publish their stories on their own terms when it comes to the tehnology being used. 

My goal is simple: Writers should be able to write using their favorite editor, own the contant they produce and publish it in an easy way. Pages they produce should be readable, appealing, beautifully crafted; in one word - pretty.
