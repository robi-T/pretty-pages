# Pretty Pages
## Your story in the digital world on your own terms

With this project my itention is to prototype a digital hoby-press system using available open source technologies. 
End product should be easy to set up and use for non-technical people, writers that should be able to publish their stories on their own terms when it comes to tehnology used. 

My goal is simple: Writers should be able to write using their favorite editor, own the contant they produce and publish it in an easy way. Pages they produce should be focus on the content - readable, without pop-ups, beautifully displayed; in one word - pretty
